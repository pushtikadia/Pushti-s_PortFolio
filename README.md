## 🔮 The Vision

**Pushti's PortFolio** represents a shift from static web pages to **fluid digital experiences**. 

Designed as the central command center for **Pushti Kadia's** work, this project implements the "Aurora Glass" aesthetic—combining deep, atmospheric lighting with professional minimalism. By leveraging a custom **Virtual Routing system** and **physics-based micro-interactions**, it creates a seamless, app-like feel without the overhead of heavy frontend frameworks.

> **Core Philosophy:** "The medium is the message." The portfolio itself serves as a case study in advanced frontend engineering, accessibility, and user experience design.

## ⚡ Engineering & Capabilities

This dashboard is built on a custom interaction engine that handles state management, physics, and animations in real-time.

### 🖱️ **Physics-Based Cursor & Magnetic UI**
Instead of the default system cursor, the interface uses a **custom lag-based physics model**. 
* **Logic:** The main dot tracks raw mouse input, while the outer ring follows using **Linear Interpolation (Lerp)** with a 0.15 damping factor.
* **Magnetic Effect:** The cursor intelligently detects interactive elements (buttons, links) and "snaps" to them, expanding its radius to indicate affordance.
* **Result:** A fluid, liquid-like navigation experience that feels organically connected to the user's hand.

### 🌌 **Virtual Routing (SPA Architecture)**
A lightweight, custom-built router handles navigation without page reloads.
* **Mechanism:** JavaScript intercepts navigation clicks and dynamically swaps active content containers (`.page`) using CSS transforms.
* **Performance:** Ensures instant transitions with zero latency, maintaining a persistent state (like the background music or animation loops) throughout the session.
* **Transitions:** Utilizes cubic-bezier timing functions for smooth entry/exit animations of page sections.

### 📐 **3D Parallax Tilt Physics**
A lightweight physics script calculates the angle of entry for the mouse cursor on project cards.
* **Math:** The script computes the offset from the card's center point and maps it to a rotation matrix (max 5° on X/Y axes).
* **Smoothness:** Uses CSS `perspective(1000px)` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` for buttery smooth motion without layout thrashing.
* **Snap-back:** Cards instantly spring back to zero-state when the cursor leaves.

### 🎞️ **Procedural Texture & Atmosphere**
To avoid the "sterile" look of flat colors, the background employs a multi-layered rendering approach.
* **Aurora Engine:** Three distinct gradient orbs float on independent animation loops to create a non-repeating, organic background.
* **Film Grain:** An SVG `<filter>` with `feTurbulence` generates fractal noise, adding a subtle "film grain" texture that enhances the dark mode aesthetic and reduces banding.
