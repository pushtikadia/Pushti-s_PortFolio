## 🔮 The Vision

**Pushti-io** represents a shift from static web pages to **spatial digital environments**. 

Designed as the central command center for **Pushti Kadia's** work, this project challenges the standard "flat" portfolio archetype. By leveraging advanced **DOM manipulation**, **hardware-accelerated CSS**, and **procedural lighting**, it creates a tactile, holographic experience that feels alive. 

> **Core Philosophy:** "The medium is the message." The portfolio itself serves as a case study in advanced frontend engineering and user experience design.

## ⚡ Engineering & Capabilities

This dashboard is built on a custom micro-interaction engine that handles physics and lighting in real-time.

### 🔦 **Dynamic Spotlight UI (Raycasting)**
Instead of static hover states, the interface uses a **coordinate-aware lighting system**. 
* **Logic:** JavaScript tracks the cursor position (`e.clientX`, `e.clientY`) relative to each card's bounding box.
* **Rendering:** It updates CSS variables (`--mouse-x`, `--mouse-y`) instantly to paint a radial gradient mask. 
* **Effect:** This creates a "flashlight" effect that reveals borders and textures only where you are looking, mimicking high-end dashboard displays.

### 📐 **3D Parallax Tilt Physics**
A lightweight physics script calculates the angle of entry for the mouse cursor.
* **Math:** The script computes the offset from the card's center point and maps it to a rotation matrix (max 15° on X/Y axes).
* **Smoothness:** Uses CSS `perspective(1000px)` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` for buttery smooth motion without layout thrashing.
* **Snap-back:** Cards instantly spring back to zero-state when the cursor leaves.

### 🎞️ **Procedural Texture Generation**
To avoid the "sterile" look of flat colors, the background employs an **SVG Turbulence Filter**.
* **Technique:** An SVG `<filter>` with `feTurbulence` generates fractal noise.
* **Result:** A subtle, cinematic "film grain" that adds depth and texture to the dark mode aesthetic, reducing eye strain and increasing perceived quality.

### 🕰️ **Live Telemetry & Localization**
The dashboard maintains a real-time connection to the developer's physical context.
* **Sync:** Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to sync the on-screen clock specifically to **IST (Indian Standard Time)**.
* **Status:** Dynamic availability indicators ("Ping" animations) signal readiness for new collaborations.
